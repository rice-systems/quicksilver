This repo is dedicated to use an async daemon to
promote FreeBSD data pages as superpages.

It starts from FreeBSD 11.2 release. There are
3 things to be developed:
	1. The async daemon should be able to scan
	reservations in the part-pop queue periodically.

	2. The early promotion code should be able
	to fully-populate a reservation with non-temporal
	stores

	3. Upon promotion, the pv-entries to the 4KB pages must be discarded, i.e. the memory of which must be recycled.

For copyright information, please see the file COPYRIGHT in this
directory (additional copyright information also exists for some

The Makefile in this directory supports a number of targets for
building components (or all) of the FreeBSD source tree.  See build(7)
and http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html
for more information, including setting make(1) variables.

The `buildkernel` and `installkernel` targets build and install
the kernel and the modules (see below).  Please see the top of
the Makefile in this directory for more information on the
standard build targets and compile-time flags.

Building a kernel is a somewhat more involved process.  See build(7), config(8),
and http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html
for more information.

Note: If you want to build and install the kernel with the
`buildkernel` and `installkernel` targets, you might need to build
world before.  More information is available in the handbook.

The kernel configuration files reside in the sys/<arch>/conf
sub-directory.  GENERIC is the default configuration used in release builds.
NOTES contains entries and documentation for all possible
devices, not just those commonly used.
