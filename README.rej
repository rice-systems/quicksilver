-This repo is dedicated to use an async daemon to
-promote FreeBSD data pages as superpages.
-
-It starts from FreeBSD 11.2 release. There are
-3 things to be developed:
-	1. The async daemon should be able to scan
-	reservations in the part-pop queue periodically.
-
-	2. The early promotion code should be able
-	to fully-populate a reservation with non-temporal
-	stores
-
-	3. Upon promotion, the pv-entries to the 4KB pages must be discarded, i.e. the memory of which must be recycled.
